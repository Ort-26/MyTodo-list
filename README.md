## About this project
This project was made with the objective of help myself to track my own todo's at the time I practice JS, React and Bootstrap for styles.
Due to some confidential information I am going to store, this application will be stateless (until I develop a formal backend with its security)
All the information will be stored as a JSON locally

### `npm start`
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
